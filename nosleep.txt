In many situations, it's really annoying when Windows locks or goes into sleep/screensaver mode when you are working with multiple PCs. I have come across this free utility which helps you to prevent it. The utility is written in AutoIt (basic-like script language for automation in Windows). It is a standalone .exe, while running you can see it in your system tray.

How it works?
The utility is programmed to move your mouse one pixel to the left and one pixel to the right every 30 seconds. Simple, right?
